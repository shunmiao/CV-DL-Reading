### [TransMOT: Spatial-Temporal Graph Transformer for Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00194v2.pdf)

#### Overall impression

Most SOTA MOT methods adopt the tracking-by-detction strategy, where target candidates proposed by the object detector on each frame are associated and tracked. This paper introduces a target association method using graph formulation and spatial/temporal transformer.
